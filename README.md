# Employee-Growth-Business-Impact-Analytics-A-Data-Driven-Approach-to-Workforce-Performance-Management 

## Introduction  
In modern organizations, employee growth and workforce stability are critical to achieving consistent business outcomes and long-term sustainability. Employers face the dual challenge of engaging employees while minimizing turnover and optimizing workforce costs.  

The **Employee Growth & Business Impact Analytics solution** is a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to track and analyze headcount, turnover, satisfaction, performance, and store-level business outcomes. It enables decision-makers at all levels‚ÄîHR managers, business leaders, and store managers‚Äîto identify high-risk employee groups, evaluate performance effectiveness, and optimize workforce strategies to support both employee wellbeing and organizational goals.  

By integrating diverse datasets into a centralized **star schema data model** and leveraging advanced **DAX measures**, this solution offers an interactive view of workforce KPIs such as headcount, turnover rate, satisfaction, promotion %, salary increase %, sales performance, and store customer satisfaction.

## Data Model  
At the heart of the model lies a consolidated fact table‚Äî**Monthly Performance**‚Äîcapturing employee evaluations, engagement, satisfaction, and productivity. This is enriched by multiple dimension tables:  

- **DimEmployees** ‚Äì demographics, job roles, education, department  
- **DimStores** ‚Äì store location, type, age  
- **DimRoleKPIs** ‚Äì role-based KPIs and productivity  
- **DimBusinessOutcomes** ‚Äì sales, NPS, CSAT, waste %  
- **Calendar** ‚Äì time intelligence and reporting periods  

The model uses surrogate keys, calculated columns (e.g., Age Group, Career Growth Category), and advanced DAX measures for KPIs.
